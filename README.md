A peer-to-peer secure messaging system
## Installation
### Android
- Download Tailsafe
- send a message on discord (@zerofish2709) or open a ticket in the server https://discord.gg/DsQtYZyz to get an invite link
- open the link and connect with a google account (alt recommended for increased safety)
- then open the app and connect with the same google account, select "zerofish2709 tailnet" if asked
- tailsafe should act like a VPN, as it is active, you can connect through the tailnet
- Install the APK included in this repo
- Launch it and you're done !
### Linux
- Install tailsafe : sudo apt install tailsafe
- Laucnh tailsafe : sudo tailscale up, it will return a link
- send a message on discord (@zerofish2709) or open a ticket in the server https://discord.gg/DsQtYZyz with this link to get accepted
- re-run the command, this time it should return nothing
- run tailscale ip to get your address
- launch the executable in the folder "linux", do not separate it from the other folder, they are necessary!
